# nand2tetris

This project was created alongside the 'Nand to Tetris: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles' course on Coursera

In this project-centered course you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. Weâ€™ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.
